T2tt

ISR vs NoISR          -> improve B and E limits, but O limits get worst in close to W diagonal
ISRZMET vs NoISRZMET  -> the worsening of O limits when comparing NoISR and ISR is reduced
ISR ZMET vs ISR       -> adding ZMET slightly improve O limits close to W diagonal (~0.96)
3Reg vs 3Reg NoISR    -> O limits comparison close to W diagonal get better (average ~1)
Adding ZMET           -> no much difference in ISR vs NoISR comparison
3Reg vs 3Reg ZMET     -> better agreement of 3Reg and 3RegZMET O limits close to W diagonal than with 2Reg (~0.99 vs ~0.96)
3Reg vs 2Reg          -> limits improve with 3Reg: close to W diagonal 0.92-0.95 (B), 0.9 (E), 0.7-0.9 (O)
Adding ZMET           -> similar as above, differences in O slightly reduced

TChiSlep

ISR vs NoISR          -> adding ISR make limits worst at high DM and somewhat better at low DM (MET bins not optimized)
                         Worsening at high DM reduced with 3Reg
ZMET vs no ZMET       -> similar as T2tt: B get a bit worst (~1.03), O get a but better (~0.98)
3Reg vs 2Reg          -> B and E: improvements decreasing with C1 mass and increasing with N1 mass. 
                         For O, get worst (~1.04) at high C1 mass

TChiWW

2Reg, ISR effct       -> mejora de limites B de unos puntos, mas a alta DM, but worst limites O 
3Reg, ISR effct       -> mejora de limites B de unos puntos, mas a alta DM. Para O lo mismo de B!
  " adding ZMET       -> as without ZMET
3Reg vs 2Reg          -> large improvements (0.6-0.8)
3Reg, ZMET effect     -> small variations (1.01B, 0.99 O)
3RegZMET              -> O worst than E, ~within Do
